# RPi CM4 Fast Fourier Transforms
These python scripts were some work in progress scripts to be used on a Raspberry Pi CM4 mounted to a custom carrier board.  The carrier board was an industrial systems monitor that among other things was reading the AC wall voltage, analyzing it, and managing Ethernet/Industrial Protocol communications.  These scripts were written to test the efficiency of running Fast Fourier Transforms to analyze the AC voltage sine wave, plot it to a graph, and upload the graph to a local http server for viewing on a different machine.  While working on this project, I also learned about Linux systems (specifically Raspbian) and the terminal, ssh tunnels, networks and Industrial Protocol.
