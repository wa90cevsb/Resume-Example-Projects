# Power Monitor Project
This project was written to run on a PIC18F45K40 microcontroller.  The product was going to be used as an accessory on a motorcycle to regulate the power consumption of other accessory devices.  Among other things, the code was responsible for managing software controlled power relays, ADC current readings, and timeouts/sleep modes for reduced current consumption while not in use.
